# Building an own version of the mdl_wrapper requires the MDL SDK to be
# unpacked into "SDK/support/mdl-sdk" and reconfigure the project with CMake.
# With the MDL SDK you can also directly use the mdl_helper instead of
# the mdl_wrapper, making it possible to provide material parameters
# and to inspect the compiled materials.
#
# The MDL SDK can be downloaded from https://developer.nvidia.com/mdl-sdk.
# Alternatively, it can be built from source after cloning the repository
# on GitHub https://github.com/NVIDIA/MDL-SDK. In case of the latter, the
# compiled binaries libmdl_sdk, dds, nv_freeimage (incl. freeimage.dll
# on WIN32) have to be copied or symlinked to "SDK/support/mdl-sdk/<platform>/".
